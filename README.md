# X1C7-OpenCore-Hackintosh

** This is NOT for daily use. I did this in under a day. Everything you need works; trackpad (recognized as trackpad so no force touch), battery readings, GPU acceleration, WiFi (thank you AirportItlwm devs for getting a Ventura alpha out so fast!!)**

This README.md is not a tutorial. I just wanted to commit this to remove the information from the old README which won't work with this. Some stuff with the kexts and ACPI (e.g _OSI to XOSI) is in the config.plist, though I do not recommend you just use mine. If you run into certain issues (battery, trackpad, etc) just create an issue **on this branch** and I'll help.
